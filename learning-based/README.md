# learning-based-methods-for-human-pose-estimation
This folder is about how to implement your learning-based method for skeleton tracking in Linux system(like Ubuntu 16.04, Ubuntu18.04), including detailed tutorials.

Human pose estimation/human skeleton tracking problem can be divided into 4 parts:
- Single-Person Skeleton Estimation
- Multi-person Pose Estimation
- Video Pose Tracking
- 3D Skeleton Estimation

In this project, I would focus on some open-source, fast and lightweight neural networks for human pose estimation. Maybe I would move forward in two directions:
 - 2D human pose estimation + depth image 
 - 3D human pose estimation from a webcam
